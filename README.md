Hi! Iâ€™m a frontend developer.

For the last year and a half, I was one of two frontend developers for <a href="https://panel.inksearch.co/">INKbusiness</a>, a CRM used by 2000+ subscribers, and part of product design team. Main technologies include <b>React</b>, <b>Redux</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>Next.js</b> and <b>MUI/Mantine</b>. Since January 2024 also a part of <b>UX/UI</b> team (<b>Figma</b>), from then on being involved in product design from the very beginning to the very end.

Features and functionalities developed include: job offer posting; history logs of user-created calendar events; tattoo convention tickets booking; online & printable client surveys; inventory system connected with on-site store.  

Sole designer and frontend developer of <a href="https://jobs.inksearch.co/pl">INKjobs</a>. Frontend developer of <a href="https://artsmith.io/">ARTsmith</a> and <a href="https://www.inksearch.co/">INKsearch</a>. 

</br>
</br>

Back in 2022, I've worked for an agency preparing top-notch headless e-commerce websites using: <b>React</b>, <b>Typescript</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, <b>Sanity.io</b>, <b>Shopify Storefront API</b>. Worked directly with designers and foreign clients in small teams. 

One of two developers who created online store for <a href="https://magaljewelry.com/">Magal Jewelry</a> from scratch in four months; single-handedly developed another e-commerce project in Framer Web.

<b><code>Selection of my personal projects:</code></b>

Currently my personal project aims to be a space for me to put my newly acquired UX/UI skills to use & to refresh knowledge of Sanity and Shopify.
I've chosen a small, growing brand to try and redesign its online store. I wanted to enhance user experience, reflect the ideas standing behind the brand better and develop a configuration that will allow the site to grow in the future, and yet will be easy to manage by a small team.
