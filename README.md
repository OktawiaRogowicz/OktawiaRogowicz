Hi! :wave: 

I‚Äôm a junior software engineer currently working with <b>Java</b> and <b>SQL</b> that touched the topic of front end just during my engineering thesis - and in the moment had a realisation that maybe, maybe it is the thing I would prefer to do profesionally. As a result, since February I am on a mission to study JavaScript by myself to eventually try and become a <code><b>front-end developer</b></code>!
